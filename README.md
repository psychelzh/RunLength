# Run Length Encoding for MATLAB

## Introduction

This is a project from [`MATLAB` file exchange](https://cn.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41813-runlength), which is original written by [Jan Simon](https://cn.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/869888-jan-simon).

Many thanks for his great job, and a pity he is not on `Github`.

## More information

Written in `C`, and can be compiled to `.mex`, which is very useful.
